# FSTT
Security Assignment

This is the README file for the FSTT project.

## Project Description

The FSTT project is a security assignment that aims to implement a program for identifying 

## Files

The project folder contains the following files:

- `Main.py`: This is the main entry point of the program. It serves as the starting point for executing the program.
- `Dockerscanvul.py`: This file contains the implementation of a vulnerability scanning tool specifically designed for Docker containers. It includes various security checks and tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in Docker images and containers. The tool can be used to assess the security posture of Docker deployments and help identify and mitigate security risks.
- `TestingURLScanner.py`: This file contains the implementation of a URL scanner for testing purposes. It is responsible for finding services throw the localhosts.
- `Testingsitescanner.py`: This file contains the implementation of scan a given URL and detect the technologies used in the frontend of the website. It does this by fetching the HTML of the page and then parsing it to find clues about the technologies used.
- `ScanVul.py`:This file  used to identify vulnerabilities in a given website, particularly those that use WordPress. It uses the vulners API and wpscan tool to perform the vulnerability scanning.
- `CmsversionFinder.py`:This file  used to designed to detect the version of a Content Management System (CMS) used by a website.
- `CmsversionFinder.py`:This file  used to designed to detect the version of a Content Management System (CMS) used by a website.
- `PredictTheDatabaseVersion.py`:the file is a set of functions that work together to determine the most compatible database for a given CMS (Content Management System) version with `compatibility_table.csv`.
- `Convert.py`:the file designed to convert text files (.txt) into PDF files (.pdf). It consists of two main functions: convert_txt_to_pdf and Convert.

## Usage

To use the program, follow these steps:


1. Install this libraries :

    - `requests`: This library is used for making HTTP requests.
    - `beautifulsoup4`: This library is used for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates parse trees that are helpful to extract the data easily.
    ```python
    command : pip install requests beautifulsoup4
    ```
    - `re`: This is a built-in Python module used for working with regular expressions.
    - `fpdf`: This library is used for creating PDF files in Python.
    - `os`: This is a built-in Python module for interacting with the operating system.
    - `subprocess`: This is a built-in Python module for spawning new processes, connecting to their input/output/error pipes, and obtaining their return codes.
    - `json`: This is a built-in Python module for working with JSON data.
    - `Docker`: This is not a Python library, but a platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. The code uses Docker commands, so Docker needs to be installed on the machine where this code will run.
    - `Trivy`: This is a simple and comprehensive vulnerability scanner for containers. The code uses the trivy command, so Trivy needs to be installed on the machine where this code will run.
    - `vulners`: This library is used for interacting with the Vulners Database API to search for vulnerabilities.
    ```python
    command : pip install vulners
    ```

    - `WPScan`: This is not a Python library, but a black box WordPress vulnerability scanner. The code uses the wpscan command, so WPScan needs to be installed on the machine where this code will run.


2. Run the program by running following file:
    ```
    python Main.py
    ```
