This is the README file for the FSTT project.

## Project Description

The FSTT project is a security assignment that aims to implement a program for identifying 

## Files

The project folder contains the following files:

- `Main.py`: This is the main entry point of the program. It serves as the starting point for executing the program.
- `Dockerscanvul.py`: This file contains the implementation of a vulnerability scanning tool specifically designed for Docker containers. It includes various security checks and tests to identify potential vulnerabilities in Docker images and containers. The tool can be used to assess the security posture of Docker deployments and help identify and mitigate security risks.
- `TestingURLScanner.py`: This file contains the implementation of a URL scanner for testing purposes. It is responsible for finding services throw the localhosts.
- `Testingsitescanner.py`: This file contains the implementation of scan a given URL and detect the technologies used in the frontend of the website. It does this by fetching the HTML of the page and then parsing it to find clues about the technologies used.
- `ScanVul.py`:This file  used to identify vulnerabilities in a given website, particularly those that use WordPress. It uses the vulners API and wpscan tool to perform the vulnerability scanning.
- `CmsversionFinder.py`:This file  used to designed to detect the version of a Content Management System (CMS) used by a website.
- `CmsversionFinder.py`:This file  used to designed to detect the version of a Content Management System (CMS) used by a website.
- `PredictTheDatabaseVersion.py`:the file is a set of functions that work together to determine the most compatible database for a given CMS (Content Management System) version with `compatibility_table.csv`.
- `Convert.py`:the file designed to convert text files (.txt) into PDF files (.pdf). It consists of two main functions: convert_txt_to_pdf and Convert.
## Usage
