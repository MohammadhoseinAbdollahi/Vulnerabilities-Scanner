  Description: Out-of-bounds Read vulnerability in mod_macro of Apache HTTP Server.This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: through 2.4.57.
  CVSS Score: 6.4

- CVE ID: software
  Description: An attacker, opening a HTTP/2 connection with an initial window size of 0, was able to block handling of that connection indefinitely in Apache HTTP Server. This could be used to exhaust worker resources in the server, similar to the well known "slow loris" attack pattern.This has been fixed in version 2.4.58, so that such connection are terminated properly after the configured connection timeout.This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.55 through 2.4.57.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.
  CVSS Score: 5.0

- CVE ID: software
  Description: When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close. A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might run out of memory before that.This was found by the reporter during testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before the connection closes or times out.Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

  Description: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in jQuery before 1.6.3, when using location.hash to select elements, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted tag.
  CVSS Score: 4.3

- CVE ID: NVD
  Description: jQuery before 1.9.0 is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The jQuery(strInput) function does not differentiate selectors from HTML in a reliable fashion. In vulnerable versions, jQuery determined whether the input was HTML by looking for the '<' character anywhere in the string, giving attackers more flexibility when attempting to construct a malicious payload. In fixed versions, jQuery only deems the input to be HTML if it explicitly starts with the '<' character, limiting exploitability only to attackers who can control the beginning of a string, which is far less common.

  Description: The jQuery Validation Plugin provides drop-in validation for your existing forms. It is published as an npm package "jquery-validation". jquery-validation before version 1.19.3 contains one or more regular expressions that are vulnerable to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service). This is fixed in 1.19.3.

- CVE ID: NVD
  Description: The jQuery Validation Plugin (jquery-validation) provides drop-in validation for forms. Versions of jquery-validation prior to 1.19.5 are vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) when an attacker is able to supply arbitrary input to the url2 method. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-43306. Users should upgrade to version 1.19.5 to receive a patch.

  CVSS Score: 4.3

- CVE ID: software
  Description: Affected versions of `jquery` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This occurs because the main `jquery` function uses a regular expression to differentiate between HTML and selectors, but does not properly anchor the regular expression. The result is that `jquery` may interpret HTML as selectors when given certain inputs, allowing for client side code execution.

## Proof of Concept
```
$("#log").html(
    $("element[attribute='<img src=\"x\" onerror=\"alert(1)\" />']").html()
);
```




## Recommendation

Update to version 1.9.0 or later.
